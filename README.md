# Project-Horiseon Webpage Refactored

## Discovery the newly improved and updated version of the Horiseon Website. Refactored HTML, and CSS for maxium accessability as well as optimized functionality

## Description 

- Our key motivator for refactoring the code of this webpage was to fill in the gaps which were left behind to ensure maxium functionality and accessability

- I embarked on refactoring the code to give their functionality a face-lift by eliminating bugs, and optimizing the overall structure of the code. 

- Horiseon is now revamped with accessability and search engine optimization in mind, leaving for a webpage which ensures a smooth experience for all users.

- During this venture I learned how organization can leave the code looking much more compact, and allow the code to not repeat it's parameters for styling individual elements.
